    "# Find brain states using Hidden Markov Model\n",
    "In this notebook there are functions and their explanations for finding hidden brain states using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for datas stored in a three dimensional numpy array or a list. The core codes are developed in the Lab of Linderman, see [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/#williams2021generalized). An example of their papers in which they use a HMM you find [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/621540v1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting started**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to install the codes from their github repository, see [here](https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm). In this repository you will find a detailed description of how to download the codes (it works!), additionaly a lot of information concerning Hidden Markov Models and examples are given with detailed descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook additionly uses some helper functions which are stored in .py files. These .py files together with the data collected by Dr. Y. Galleros-Salas, see [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320308138), and preprocessed by Aleksejs Fomins (stored in a H5py container) are bundled in folders: Yasir data mouse 5, Yasir data mouse 6, Yasir data mouse 7, and Yasir data mouse 9. You find these folders on our workspase \"neurophysiology\", in the subfolder \"Transfer/Susanne/HMM brainstates\". Copy these folders into your JuptiterNotebooks folder. For example if you want to analyse the data for mouse 5 (please note that the mice are renamed in the paper mentioned above: M5 (data) --> M2(paper), M6(data) --> M4(paper), M7(data) --> M5(paper) and M9(data) --> M3(paper)) it is recommended that your working directory is the \"Yasir data mouse 5\" directory. This ensures that, if you want to save plots, they are stored there in automatically generated subdirectories of this directory. It is technically possible to analyse the data of all mice from one of the directories (e.g. current directory: \"Yasir data mouse 5\" from there you can analyse M6 data, but then the automatically created subfolder for M6 plots will be subfolders of \"Yasir data mouse 5\" and not of \"Yasir data mouse 6\"). It is also possible to fit the model to all mice (and all trial types) from the working directory \"Yasir data mouse 5\",e.g., but again the analysed/stored plots for e.g. M6 is in a subfolder of \"Yasir data mouse 5\" and not \"Yasir data mouse 6\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have your own datas to analyse, you also have to copy one of these folders to your JupiterNotebooks because they not only contain the data but also the functions calling the core codes for fitting, finding the most probable brain states and helper functions. But you can delete the files containing the data (.h5 file) and metadata (eg. mouse_5_2017_03_06_session01, etc). Introduce your data in block 4, it has to be a 3d numpy array or a list of single trials as explained below. In addition some variables have to be defined, such as \"name\", \"trial_type\", \"frames\", \"delay\", \"title\" and \"file\". These are used for the titles of the plots and the names of the files in which they are automatically stored, see arguments for the plot functions. Of course you can also change the plotting functions in the .py files or introduce your own plotting functions.\n",

    "**Structure of the notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "First one has to define which sessions are included in the fitting procedure and in the algorithm for finding the most probable state sequence (viterbi algorithm). The arrays have to match in one or more dimensions therefore not all combinations of sessions are always allowed if you would like to use averaged data (3d array, shape (trials, time steps, dimensions). If you would like to work with concatenated data, all combinations are allowed (list, elements are single trials, 2d arrays(time steps, dimensions). In a behavior task a session contains usually several trial types, e.g. in the data of Dr. Galleros-Salas: Hit, FA, CR, Early and Miss. The brain states and/or the brain state sequence of different trial types are at least partially different. Therefore in the selected sessions usually trials of a specific type are taken. But it can be interesting to fit the model to all, unsorted trials and analyse sorted data with the viterbi algorithm using the model fitted to all data. The option 'All' is therefore also included. Next, the data of the selected sessions and trial type are gathered in a 3d array \"data\" or in a list \"lst_obs\". These steps are done in code blocks 1 to 4 and can be skipped if you do not work with Dr. Galleros-Salas's data. Remark: the expression \"time_steps\" and \"frames\" are both used in this notebook and define both a metric for time. The length of a trial (the shape of the 3d array, axis = 1, respectively in the 2d array, axis = 0) is the largest frame/time_step number. One frame/time_step corresponds to 50 ms for Dr. Galeros-Salas's data, or 20 frames = 1 second.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the data are prepared for the fitting and for the viterbi code, Code blocks 5 to 8. There are different ways to prepare the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *averaged data:*<br/> \n",
    "  The 3 dimensional array \"data\" is averaged over axis 0 (trials). The result is a 2 dimensional array of shape               (time_steps, ROI's). This array \"obs_aver\" can be used for fitting and for the viterbi algorithm.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *concatenated data:* <br/>\n",
    "  All trials are concatenated along axis 1 (time_steps) for the 3d array or axis 0 in the case of list elements. The result   is a 2 dimensional array of shape (number of trials x time_steps, ROI's). This array \"obs_conc\" can be used for fitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *single trial data:* <br/>\n",
    "  You can also use the data of one single trial which is a 2 dimensional array of shape (time_steps, ROI's). This array       \"obs_single\" can be used for the viterbi algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the possibility to look at these prepared data and save the plots. You can use block 5 to do the preparations for all kind of data if you work with the 3d array \"data\" (averaged, concatenated and single trial) at once or you can do it individually, block 6 to 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the literature dimensionality reduction is strongly recommended. Here you will have two methods for that purpose: Factor Analysing (FA) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Again you can look at these preprocessed data and save the plots, code blocks 9 to 13 for FA. You can do the FA for all kind of data (if you did the prepartions also vor all of them) in block 9. Block 10 to 12 allow individual FA. You additionally have the possiblity to do FA on each trial individually, block 13, the result is a list of dimensionality reduced single trials (shape of an element: (time steps, number of factors). PCA starts at block 14 for all kind of data at once and individually in block 15 to 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After these preparation/preprocessing steps the fitting of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on these prepared/preprocessed data can be done, blocks 18 and 19. You have the possibility to plot/save the fitting curve. This is recommended, to check if the number of iterations is sufficient to get a stable likelihood (50 to 100 iterations usually is enough). If you choose to save the figure, all the upcoming figures are saved. The model can be fitted in principle on any kind of prepared/preprocessed data. But to fit a model to single trial data makes not much sense. Recommended are averaged data (fast, good overview) or concatenated data. In the case of FA or non dimensionality reduced data one can also use a list of single trials which is accepted as an input to the fitting algorithm. Therein the elements of the list are concatenated. That is why the shape of axis 2 (number of factors or ROI's) has to be the same in all elements of the list. A summary of all kind of prepared/preprocessed data is given. Some parameters have to be defined as input to the fitting function (block 18a) and you have to choose the matching function for your data for the fit (block 18b1). You will also be asked to define the data on which the viterbi algorithm has to operate on and to choose the matching function for the viterbi algorithm (block 18b2). You will have an opportunity to change this later, if you want to work with the same fitted model on different datas, e.g. divers single trial data, which have to be selected/prepared/preprossed first according to the example work flow given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code block 20 runs the viterbi algorithm returning the most probable state sequence to explain the given observations in form of a list of state numbers and (optional) a plot representing each state number with a color. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next three blocks are optional: You can calculate and plot the state occupation time (block 21), plot the prepared and preprocessed data shaded with the state sequence (block 22) and calculate/plot the learned transition matrix (block 23).\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation (and plot) of the posterior probabilty (the probability being in a state at a specific time step given the observations seen so far), block 24, is mandatory for the following calculations of the brain states. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following block 25 is optional. It is interactive and allows to compare two vectors holding the original dF/F's for all ROI's with a simple metric (manhattan distance). You can also define precisly at which frame/time_step a state starts or ends, which is neeeded for the manually definition of substates of a brain state. For detailed information about this block, see there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract hidden states are mapped onto brain states in block 26. You have several options to plot/save the brain states. The software to map a vector holding averaged dF/F values on an anatomical brain map is written by Aleksejs Fomins (brainplot_selfcontained.py, example.ipynb, L_modified.mat). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you have the possibilty to analyse the substates. A brain state can be splittet over different not connected segments of frames. Such an individual segment is called a substate. Again you can plot/save them in block 27. There are two options: to select the substate of a specific brain state automatically (all substates are selected) or manually (you can define which substates are selected).\n",

As mentioned above the viterbi algorithm, once the parameter thereof are learned, can run on different data. For that you have to go back to do the input and/or preparation and preprocessing steps for the this (new) data. Here for example one can look for the most probable state sequence/brain states for single trials, but keep the model fitted to the averaged data. Please note that the data being used to fit the model and the data on which the viterbi algorithm runs should have to be preprocessed in the same way (either not at all, FA or PCA). Further the dimensions (axis = 1 in the 2d array) after the preprocessing step should be the same, otherwise errors will occur later. This is not always the case for the same eigenvalue limit (FA) or the explained variance (PCA). To correct for that: You change the variable \"eigenval_limit\" for FA to a different value (default 1.0) or the variable \"tot_expl_variance\" for PCA (default 0.99) until the desired dimension is generated. Further please note that if you want to *reuse the learned parameter you are not allowed to close your notebook (closing the notebook: the variables get lost).* \n",

The shape of one element of the resulting list is (number of frames, number of factors) and the length of the list is the number of trials. The number of factors have to be set to a fixed value, because the in the core code the elements of this list is concatenated and therefore the shape over the axis 1 has to be the same for all elements.

To run the fitting procedure a few parameters have to be given in advance. This is done in the block 18a. In addition you have to choose on which kind of data you want to do the fitting procedure (obs_fit). The viterbi algorithm can but don't has to run on the same data. You also have to define the data for the viterbi algorithm (obs_vit), but you can change this later easily if you want to run the viterbi algorithm on other data with the same learned parameter. In block 19a the fit is done. You can plot and save the fitting curve which is recommended to check the convergence of the fit, block 19b.

Simultanously these frames are shown in the posterior probability plot informing to which state the selected frame belongs.
